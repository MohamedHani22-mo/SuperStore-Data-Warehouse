# 📊 Business Intelligence & Data Warehouse Project

## 🎯 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI)** workflow using Microsoft tools.  
It covers everything from **data extraction and transformation** to **data modeling, analysis, and visualization**.

The goal of this project is to show how different BI technologies can work together to turn raw data into valuable business insights.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Microsoft SQL Server** – Data Warehouse and storage  
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)** – ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load)  
- **SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services)** – for star schema and cube modeling  
- **Power BI** – for dashboards and visual analytics  
- **T-SQL** – for KPI calculation and data analysis  

---

## 🧱 Data Model
The solution is based on a **Star Schema** that includes:
- A **Fact Table** containing sales transactions  
- **Dimension Tables** for customers, products, orders, addresses, and dates  
- Relationships between the tables that allow flexible and detailed analysis  

This model enables fast reporting across various dimensions like **Customer, Product, Category, Region, and Time**.

---

## 📈 Business Insights
The project analyzes multiple business areas and KPIs such as:
- Total Customers, Orders, and Products  
- Total and Average Sales per Customer and per Order  
- Sales by Category, Subcategory, and Segment  
- Top Customers by Sales and by Orders  
- Orders and Sales by Shipping Mode  
- Yearly and Regional Sales Trends  

These insights were later visualized in Power BI dashboards for better business understanding and decision-making.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboards
This project includes **five interactive dashboards**, designed to give a full view of the business performance:

1. **Customer Sales Dashboard** – total sales, orders, and performance trends  
2. **Orders Sales Dashboard** – insights based on customer behavior and group performance  
3. **Product Analysis Dashboard** – top products, category performance, and subcategory breakdowns  
4. **Sales Analysis Dashboard** – revenue comparison and profitability analysis  
5. **Time Analysis Dashboard** – performance by city and region  

Each dashboard connects directly to the Data Warehouse for real-time, accurate analysis.
